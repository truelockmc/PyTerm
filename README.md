PyTerm is a Python-based terminal emulator with two versions: a GUI application and a command-line version. Both versions provide a way to execute shell commands with a customizable interface.

## Features

- **Terminal Version**: A classic terminal interface that runs directly in your command line.
- **.exe Files**: Pre-built executable files for easy use on Windows without needing Python installed.
